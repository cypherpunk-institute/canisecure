## Only create passwords with your password manager
Do never come up with any of your passwords "manually". Unfortunately, humans are terrible with generating good entropy (good randomness). All passwords must be generated by your password manager. Use strength indicator to ensure your password is strong (roughly 128 bits of entropy). As for the characters set it is mostly irrelevant as long as the entropy (strength) indicated by your password manager is satisfying.

## Use a Password Manager
This is a tool that you would install on your system to securely store all of your passwords in an encrypted vault. There are many vendors and open-source projects that offer tools to accomplish this same goal. Choose one that has a decent community or customer following and make sure you decide which features are best for your lifestyle and turn off those you don't need. If you select a cloud-based password manager, be very sure you select one that is a market leader (e.g., [LastPass](https://lastpass.com/) or [Bitwarden](https://www.bitwarden.com/)) and ensure that you have selected a very strong master password.

## Don't reuse passwords
Passwords are regularly passed around by criminals after data breaches, which other criminals will use to try logging into other places where you may have re-used your password. Criminals also use passwords as part of phishing emails to establish rapport or as part of extortion attacks. You can view some of the data breaches that your email address has been a part of on [Have I Been Pwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com/).
